ClipoardtoPastebin
==================

A simple python  script to copy your current Clipboard to Pastebin, returning the link into the Clipboard.

Requires xsel to be installed. Therefore only works with OSes which use a xserver. 

BEFORE USING:

You need to register a Pastebin-Account and Paste the api_dev key to the part in the code. I have commented that part, it's at the end of the code.
